- The goal is to make recommendations about the toy horse product line. We first used regression to estimate the conjoint model at the individual level, and then explored the best market segmentations by conducting post-hoc clustering and priori segmentation analysis. Lastly, we simulated market shares for different product-line scenarios and identified the best possible product line strategy given considerations related to competitive response, cannibalization, profitability and long-run performance.
